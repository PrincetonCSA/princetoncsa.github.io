        The Princeton Chinese Students Association strives to expose all students on campus to Chinese food and culture. 
        We plan and host a variety of culturally themed events, ranging from study breaks to holiday festivals and banquets. 
        We also connect with local Chinese groups in an effort to share our experiences as Chinese students at Princeton.<br>

        Hey y'all! I'm Raymond, and I am the secretary of CSA. I'm a sophomore from Dallas, Texas, but contrary to popular belief, I didn't come to Princeton on horseback. I'm planning on majoring in Molecular Biology with certificates in Spanish Language and Culture and Global Health and Health Policy.

        Hi! I'm Mayee, one of the co-event coordinators! I am studying ORFE and pursuing certificates in Applications of Computing and maybe Technology and Society. I was born and raised in Williamsburg, Virginia (and by custom would annoyingly like to point out that I'm not from Northern Virginia). Besides CSA, I'm also involved with Triple 8 Dance Company, Sustainable Software Initiative, Manna, and Princeton Women in Computer Science. I'm secretly a huge Kpop (Korean pop) fangirl – oops, wrong club description... – and in my free time I like to drink various teas, do math, and identify tree species.

        Hi, I'm Selina, resident of the beautiful and smart state of South Carolina and Publicity Co-Chair of CSA. From a young age I've been fascinated by art, including Chinese embroidery, brush art, and paper cuts, so I joined the publicity team to stay involved. I've learned quite a bit about graphic design making fun flyers to advertise our events, such as a Peking duck study break and our Year of the Monkey Lunar Banquet last February. As an ORFE major with an intended certificate in global health and health policy, I also get very excited about applied math, nutrition, and food in general. On campus, you may find me doing Peer Health Advisor duties, watching French films, and breakdancing with Sympoh too.
