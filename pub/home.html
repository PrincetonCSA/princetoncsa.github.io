        The Princeton Chinese Students Association strives to expose all students on campus to Chinese food and culture. 
        We plan and host a variety of culturally themed events, ranging from study breaks to holiday festivals and banquets. 
        We also connect with local Chinese groups in an effort to share our experiences as Chinese students at Princeton.<br>

    <h3>Mayee Chen '19</h3><h4> <em>Co-President</em></h4>
    <p>Hi everyone! I'm Mayee, one of CSA's co-presidents. I'm an ORFE major pursuing a certificate in Applications of Computing, and I proudly hail from Williamsburg, VA (although the Chinese food is quite terrible there). Aside from CSA, I am also involved in Triple 8 Dance Company, Envision's conference team, the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month planning committee, Princeton Corporate Finance Club, Women in Computer Science, my sorority, and grading for the Computer Science department. In my spare time my hobbies range from doing math and composing music to identifying trees and feeling conflicted about machine learning. Thanks for checking out our website!</p>

    <h3>Raymond Guo '19</h3><h4> <em>Co-President</em></h4>
    <p>Hey y'all! I'm Raymond, and I am one of the co-presidents of CSA. I'm a junior from Dallas, Texas, but contrary to popular belief, I didn't come to Princeton on horseback. I'm majoring in Molecular Biology with certificates in Spanish Language and Culture and Global Health and Health Policy. Outside of CSA, I sing in the Glee Club, serve on the Dual Degrees Committee of the Princeton Premedical Society, tutor at the McGraw Center, and volunteer at the UMCPP hospital. In my free time, I enjoy late-night jam sessions and quoting Pixar movies. Ask me to recite the office scene from <em>The Incredibles</em>: it’s my personal favorite.</p>

        <p>Hello there! What do you call a fake noodle? ... an imPASTA! Noodles - fake and real - just happen to be my favorite food. I'm from Southern California (best part of the best state), and I'm constantly craving good Asian food. Luckily, I have CSA fam to search for noodle dishes in the coming years. I'm a pretty dorky sophomore interested in Molecular Biology and my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist. You can usually find me somewhere in Mathey College or a library. "Udon" know how excited I am for this year!!</p>

        <h3>Janet Lee '20</h3><h4> <em> Treasurer</em></h4>
        <p>¡Hola! Whoops, wrong student organization… 你好! My name is Janet, and I am the Treasurer of CSA. I was born and raised in the heart of the Bay Area, CA, which most definitely has the best Chinese food in the country. I am pursuing a degree in Economics and certificates in Finance, Applications of Computing, and Spanish (now taking bets on whether I will survive!). When I’m not drinking boba at Kung Fu Tea or frequenting Frist Gallery during late meal, you can catch me in Naacho South Asian Dance Company, Manna Christian Fellowship, Princeton Student Events Committee, and the McGraw Center!</p>

        <p>Hi! I'm Michael, and I am pleased to be the Event Coordinator for CSA. Currently I'm majoring in mathematics, and still clueless about certificates and life. I'm from San Francisco, California (fun fact: the fortune cookie was invented there by a Japanese resident. Source: Google). Back at home, I enjoy cooking and eating hipster food. (Think kimchi burritos, rolled ice cream, and soup dumplings. Wait, the last one is just awesome normal food.) At Princeton, if I'm not doing psets, watching movies, and ordering food for CSA, I'm part of Princeton Competitive Engineering's Hyperloop team and Club Swim, where I try to lose the weight that I gain at home.</p>

        <p>Hey! I’m Annie, one of the social chairs for CSA. I’m a sophomore hailing from Columbus, Ohio, the land of eternal winter and corn. I’m majoring in computer science, considering a finance certificate, and probably dreaming about boba. Outside of CSA, I’m involved with the Daily Princetonian, Science Olympiad, Sinfonia, Music in Mind, and Tiger Challenge. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, card games, jazz music, reading manga, trying new foods, and making lists way too long. If I were a fruit, I think I’d be a yumberry :*</p>

        <p>Hello there! My name is Tony, and I'm one of the publicity chairs (a.k.a. the 安 team) for CSA. I'm an ORFE major and proud Matheyite from Memphis, TN. Outside of CSA, I also play piano with the Princeton Pianists Ensemble. I'm usually buried somewhere in the depths of Firestone, but above ground you will likely find me at late meal or eating food in general (preferably of the free kind).</p>

        <p>Hi there! My name is Angela, and I'm one of the publicity chairs for CSA. I'm from Urbana, Illinois (all we got is UIUC + corn + Chicago 2 hours away). I'm currently working toward a Chemistry major with an Applications of Computing certificate, but this is open to change. Outside of class, I'm also an editor for PJEAS and a writer for Spoon University. I am a sucker for food, and my forever favorite Chinese food is the iconic Shanghai-originated Sheng Jian bun. I also enjoy drawing, playing soccer, swimming, dancing for fun, and night running. Feel free to reach out to me about anything!</p>

        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Geoffrey and I’m the Community Outreach and Alumni Liaison Chair for CSA.  I was born and raised in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, so I did not know what winter was like until I came to Princeton. I’m a sophomore planning on majoring in physics and getting a certificate in East Asian Studies.  Outside of CSA, I am involved in the Ballroom Dance Club, Club Badminton, and Princeton Journal of East Asian Studies.  When I’m not working on a pset (which is almost never), I enjoy playing piano, tennis, and watching movies (not all at the same time though lol).</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, I'll be the CSA historian this year! I'm from Canada, but born and raised in Xi'an, one of the oldest cities in China, I know Chinese dance and calligraphy and share a passion in the Chinese culture and history. Outside of CSA, I do ballroom and lyrical dancing and take/edit lots of photos on my own or for the Daily Princetonian. With a love for the outdoors, I believe that sunrise and sunset are two of the most romantic things in nature."</p>

    <p>Heyyo; my name is David and Raymond managed to drag me on board this year. jkjk...I love CSA fam <3! I have lived in NJ for my entire life and somehow ended up ten miles down the road for college. I am majoring in Computer Science and pursuing certificates in Quantitative and Computational Biology as well as Statistics and Machine Learning (try saying that 5 times fast :O). On campus outside of CSA, I direct the bi-annual HackPrinceton, serve as director emeritus for Science Olympiad, and am involved with the Princeton University Math Competition, Princeton Undergraduate Research Journal, Manna and Table Tennis Club. Supposedly I play clarinet too.</p>
