        The Princeton Chinese Students Association strives to expose all students on campus to Chinese food and culture. 
        We plan and host a variety of culturally themed events, ranging from study breaks to holiday festivals and banquets. 
        We also connect with local Chinese groups in an effort to share our experiences as Chinese students at Princeton.<br>

    <h3>Brian Chen '16, Co-President</h3><br>
    Brian is a junior from the 626/SGV Asian capital of Los Angeles, where great food and boba await those hungry enough to come visit. 
    Although Chinese, he is also on the TASA board, a sign of openness and acceptance between the two groups. 
    He is a two-time CA leader and works at the Pace Center. 
    In his free time, he likes to make things look nice - his room, his crafts, his homework, etc. 
    If you see him at the gym, give him some encouragement so that he can eat lots of food when he gets home.

    <h3>Julie Kwong '16, Co-President</h3><br>
    Julie is a current junior in the Psychology Department, pursuing the TeacherPrep certification for the area of math.
    She is from the lovely town of Rockville, MD right outside of DC and comes from a Cantonese-speaking family. 
    Outside of CSA, she loves to eat, snap photos, snap photos of the things she eats, and sing. 
    Her first flight ever was this past summer to Beijing to study Chinese and her biggest phobia is of getting papercuts. 
    Her favorite thing about CSA has to be the family love within it. CS-AI <3

        <h3>Marsha Zhang '17, Co-Events Coordinator</h3><br>
        Marsha loves CSA and all things Chinese including - the culture and festivals, the history, the language, and especially Mandopop. 
        Funnily enough, the only thing she isn't crazy for is Chinese food (probably because she overindulged this past summer in Shanghai), 
        but she does enjoy making large quantities of scallion pancakes for her CSA family to enjoy. :)
