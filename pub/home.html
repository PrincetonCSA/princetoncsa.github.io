        The Princeton Chinese Students Association strives to expose all students on campus to Chinese food and culture. 
        We plan and host a variety of culturally themed events, ranging from study breaks to holiday festivals and banquets. 
        We also connect with local Chinese groups in an effort to share our experiences as Chinese students at Princeton.<br>
